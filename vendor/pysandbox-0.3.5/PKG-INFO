Description: The sandbox libraries (libsandbox & pysandbox) provide API's in C/C++ and Python
        for executing and profiling simple (single process) programs in a restricted 
        environment, or sandbox. These API's can help developers to build automated 
        profiling tools and watchdogs that capture and block the runtime behaviours of 
        binary programs according to configurable / programmable policies.
